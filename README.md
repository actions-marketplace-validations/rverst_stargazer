# stargazer

*stargazer* creates a sorted list of your stared github repositories.
Like an [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re) 
list, but personal.

# Inspiration

*stargazer* is inspired by [starred](https://github.com/gmolveau/starred),
which is very similar and written in python. I created *stargazer* because I
wanted to try out the [GitHub GraphQL API v4](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql).
